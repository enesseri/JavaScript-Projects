In this project, we will explore the process of recreating the iconic Tetris experience right in your browser. From designing the layout with HTML, to styling that retro vibe with CSS, to implementing the game logic with JavaScript, every step is covered to help you understand the magic behind this timeless game. 

The project is a clone project and contains my own css and javascript code. Keep coding to become a successful developer in Gaming & Web :)

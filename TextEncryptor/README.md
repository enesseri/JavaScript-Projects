# Text Encryptor

This project includes a simple text encryptor and decryptor. It encrypts texts using a specific encryption algorithm and then uses the same algorithm to decrypt these encrypted texts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the project to your computer.
2. Open your internet browser and navigate to the directory where the project is located.
3. Open the `index.html` file.
4. Once the Text Encryptor application is loaded, enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
5. Select the necessary options and complete the process.

## Encryption Algorithms

The following encryption algorithms can be used in this project:

- **Caesar Cipher:** Encrypts and decrypts texts by shifting them according to a key number.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher:** Encrypts and decrypts texts using a keyword.
